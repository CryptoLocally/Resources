In order to secure their allocation, winners will have to submit their KYC information to admin@cryptolocally.com within 12 hours of the announcement. The KYC information will have to match the full name provided in the public sale application. An example of a correct KYC submission has been provided in this GitHub repository. Those that are not on the winnerâ€™s list should NOT send KYC information.

For those that pass the KYC, we will send an email to the same email address provided on the public sale application, informing the winner of the crowdfunding wallet address. We may take until Friday 9:00AM HKT to complete the KYC verifications. The winners will then have 12 hours from the time of the email to send 100 USDT-ERC20 using the same wallet address provided in the original application.

The GIV allocation for the winners will be credited to their respective CryptoLocally accounts connected to their referral codes provided in the application. This will occur at the end of the public sale.
