# KYC Verification
​
In this guide, we will show you how to complete the KYC verification for your GIV public sale whitelist application.
​
The following documents will be required in order to complete the KYC verification:
​
- Name
- Birthdate
- Government ID number
- Residential Address
- Country of citizenship
​
NOTE: Your private information may be collected but will not be shared without prior consent.
​
**Things to know before we start** :
 To secure their allocation, winners will have to submit their KYC information to [admin@cryptolocally.com](mailto:admin@cryptolocally.com) **within 12 hours of the announcement**. The KYC information will have to match the full name provided in the public sale application. Please do NOT send KYC information if you are not on the winner&#39;s list.
​
KYC Verification involves three basic steps:
​
1. **Data Collection**
​
Write an email to [admin@cryptolocally.com](mailto:admin@cryptolocally.com) containing your personal details (same as on your ID document, see example below):
​
- Full Name: Ademo Blanka Ken Vega
- Birthdate: 25/06/1979
- Government ID number: 5986236(M)
- Residential address: 144 Queen&#39;s Road East, Wan Chai, Hong Kong
- Country of Citizenship: Hong Kong
​
​
2. **Identity Document**
​
Take a picture of yourself holding your ID document (government-issued identity cards, driver license or passport) + a piece of paper with the following information on it. Attach this picture in the email:
​
- &quot;GIV Public Sale Whitelist Application&quot;
​
- Today&#39;s date (24/09/2020)
- Your signature
​
NOTE: It is important that the picture is bright and clear, and that all the corners of the document are visible.

​
3. **Proof of residence**
​
Finally, please also attach a copy of your Proof of Residence (Bank statement, Utility Bill, Internet/Cable TV/House phone line bill, Tax return, Council tax bill or Government Issued Certifications/Residency) in the same email.
​
NOTE: If you are using an invoice for your Proof of Residence, please ensure that a &quot;billing date&quot; is present on the document (due date will not suffice).

For those that pass the KYC, we will send an email to the same email address provided on the public sale application, informing the winner of the crowdfunding wallet address. We may take until Friday 9:00AM HKT to complete the KYC verifications. The winners will then have 12 hours from the time of the email to send 100 USDT-ERC20 using the same wallet address provided in the original application.

The GIV allocation for the winners will be credited to their respective CryptoLocally accounts connected to their referral codes provided in the application. This will occur at the end of the public sale.
